We are using online news popularity dataset from UCI machine learning repository. The dataset is a collection of 61 heterogeneous set of features of approximately 40,000 articles published by Mashable (www.mashable.com) - the features are not the articles, but features extracted from the article, such as word counts, title word counts, keyword associations. The data represents a two year period of published articles, ending in January 2015.

We intend to mine this data to understand what parameters can influence an article to be shared on social media more than others. The goal is to predict the number of shares in social networks (popularity).

The business use of this data set / data mining project is ultimately to establish relationships that enable to predict how many social media shares an article published on www.mashable.com is likley to generate - with the idea that a more socially shared article has higher business value - increasing traffic to the site, and consequently, potential for higher earnings revenue associated to the increased web traffic. The user of this model is both the publishers for mashable.com for article selection, and also for authors, attempting to create content that has higher value on sites like mashable.com.

Measures for a successful outcome from a predictive model for this study will be based on overall accuracy metrics (e.g., confusion matrix), as well as AUC type metrics. A baseline (non-predictive, random) scoring will establish a baseline for these metrics, and then the predictive model can be assessed against a random model for measurement of improvement, i.e., value of the model.
